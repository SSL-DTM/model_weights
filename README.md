# Model Weights
This repo is for storing the model weights for "Self Supervised Learning for Semantic Segmentation of Archaeological Monuments in DTMs" and the corresponding repos [here](https://github.com/SSL-DTM).

It includes the following model weights:

- [semseg_DTM_random.pth](https://github.com/SSL-DTM/model_weights/releases/download/v0.0.0/semseg_DTM_random.pth): Semantic segmentation trained with DTM inputs and random weight initialization.
